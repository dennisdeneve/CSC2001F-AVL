# CSC2001F-AVL

AVL Tree data structure implementation.

This tests the efficiency of the AVL data structure implementation against tradition data strcutures such as arrays. This project is focused on the comparison operations against that of the theroetical expected complexity of the AVL data structure. In the duration of this project it was noted that the AVL tree was more efficient than both traditional data structures such as arrays and Binary Search Trees.
